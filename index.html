        <h2>What are the components of THREE js?</h2>
        <h2>Scene & lights</h2>
        <p>
            A scene must have one or more lights to make shapes visible. The scene is like a container that holds your objects cameras and lights.
        </p>
        <h2>Camera</h2>
        <p>
            To give the end user perspective on the screen. There are multiple camera types in three.js such as Array camera, cube camera and stereo camera. We will be using perspective camera. This mimics the human eyeball üëÄ 
        </p>
        <h2>Action</h2>
        <p>
           In THREE.js land this is known as rendering and is how all the magic happens üßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è When animation comes into play we can set up an infinate loop or set a different trigger like a scroll bar to change the properties on these objects to animate them.
